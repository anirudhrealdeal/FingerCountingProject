# FingerCountingProject
Track the movements of your finger and count the number of open fingers on your left hand using image processing with opencv-python and mediapipe.
The hand Tracking module which is also one of my previous projects is acessed for this project. The module is availible in this repo as well.
The FIngerCounting file has the program in it and the ictures used are 1,2,3,4,5 and 6.jpg. Create a folder called Fingers and copy these pictures onto it.
Happy Coding!
